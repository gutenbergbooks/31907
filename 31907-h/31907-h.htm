<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;">ANCIENT POTTERY OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<h3>By <span class="sc">William H. Holmes</span></h3>.

<hr class="short" />

<h3 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em;">INTRODUCTORY.</h3>

<p>This paper is the third of a series of preliminary studies of aboriginal
ceramic art which are intended to be absorbed into a final work of a
comprehensive character.</p>

<p>The groups of relics selected for these studies are in all cases of limited
extent, and are such as can lay claim to a considerable degree of
completeness. It is true that no series of arch&aelig;ologic objects can ever
be considered complete, but in exceptional cases the sources of supply
may be so thoroughly explored that the development of new features of
importance cannot reasonably be expected. If any series of American
ceramic products has reached such a condition, it is that of the middle
portions of the Mississippi Valley; yet, even in this case, I consider it
unwise to attempt a monographic study, and prefer to single out a particular
collection, making it the subject of a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>When the idea of preparing such a paper was first conceived, the collection
presenting the greatest advantages was that of the Academy of
Natural Sciences at Davenport, Iowa, which was, therefore, chosen.
Other museums, especially those at Cambridge, Saint Louis, and Washington,
were rich in material from this region, but none of these collections
were so homogeneous and satisfactory.</p>

<p>The National Museum has recently received important accessions
from the Mississippi Valley, through the agency of the Bureau of Ethnology,
and ere the publication of this paper will probably excel all
others in the number and variety of its mound relics. Some of its material
has already been published by Dr. Charles Rau, Prof. C. C. Jones,
Dr. Joseph Jones, and myself, and several additional examples are given
in this paper.</p>

<p>Professor F. W. Putnam has described and illustrated many pieces
belonging to the Peabody Museum, and Professor W. B. Potter and
Dr. Edward Evers have issued an important work on the Saint Louis
collections, in Contributions to the Arch&aelig;ology of Missouri.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[page 368]</span>

<p>This study is intended to pave the way to a thorough classification of
the multitude of relics, and to the discovery of a method of procedure
suited to a broad and exhaustive treatment of the ceramic art.</p>

<p>I do not expect to discuss ethnical questions, although ceramic studies
will eventually be of assistance in determining the distribution and
migrations of peoples, and in fixing the chronology of very remote
events in the history of pottery-making races.</p>

<p>Some of the results of my studies of the evolutionary phase of the
subject are embodied in an accompanying paper upon the "Origin and
Development of Form and Ornament," and a second paper will soon
follow. Before the final work is issued I hope to make close studies of
all the principal collections, public and private. In such a work the
importance of great numbers of examples cannot be overestimated.
Facts can be learned from a few specimens, but relationships and principles
can only be derived from the study of multitudes.</p>

<p>I shall probably have occasion to modify many of the views advanced
in these preliminary papers, but it is only by pushing out such advance
guards that the final goal can be reached.</p>

<p>Since the original issue of this paper in the Proceedings of the Davenport
Academy of Sciences, a careful revision of the text has been made
and much additional matter and a number of illustrations have been
added.</p>

<p>I wish in this place to express my obligations to the officers and members
of the Davenport Academy of Sciences, and especially to Mrs. M.
L. D. Putnam and Prof. W. H. Pratt, whose generous aid has been of
the greatest service to me.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>[page 369]</span>

<h3 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em;"> CERAMIC GROUPS.</h3>

<p>In studying the collections from the Mississippi Valley, I find it convenient
to classify the ceramic products in three great groups, which belong
to as many pretty well-defined districts; these I have named, for
convenience of treatment, the Upper Mississippi, the Middle Mississippi,
and the Lower Mississippi or Gulf provinces. Other pottery occurs within
the limits of these areas, but the examples found in the museums are so
few that very little of importance can be learned from them.</p>

<p>The three groups enumerated are not equally represented. The great
body of our collections is from the middle province. The ware of the
Lower Mississippi or Gulf district, of which we have but a small number
of pieces, has many features in common with the pottery of the middle
district, and at the same time is identical in most respects with
that of the Gulf coast to the east. No well-defined line can be drawn
between them; but the ware of the north is wholly distinct and need
never be confounded with the other groups.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em;"> MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI PROVINCE.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Distribution.</span>&mdash;It must not be inferred that there is perfect uniformity
in the pottery of this, or any other, extended region; local peculiarities
are always to be found. The products of contiguous districts,
such, for example, as those of Mississippi County, Arkansas, and New
Madrid County, Missouri, have much in common, and will at once be
recognized as belonging to the same family, yet the differences are so
marked that the unskilled observer could point them out with ease.</p>

<p>As indicated by decided family resemblances, the wares of this group
extend over the greater part of the States of Missouri, Arkansas, and
Tennessee, cover large portions of Mississippi, Kentucky, and Illinois,
and reach somewhat into Iowa, Indiana, Alabama, Louisiana, and
Texas. The types are better marked and the products more abundant
about the center of this area, which may be defined roughly as including
contiguous parts of Missouri, Arkansas, and Tennessee, with a
pretty decided focal center, at least in the abundance of relics, at Pecan
Point, Arkansas.</p>

<p>The borders of the district are necessarily not clearly defined. The
characters of the art products blend more or less with those of neighboring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>[page 370]</span>
sections. This is a usual phenomenon, and is probably due to a
variety of causes. The mere contact of peoples leads to the exchange
of ideas, and, consequently, to similarities in the products of industry.
A change of habitat, with its consequent change of environment, is capable
of modifying art to a great extent. Groups of relics and remains
attributed by arch&aelig;ologists to distinct stocks of people, may, in cases,
be the work of one and the same people executed under the influence of
different environments and at widely separated periods of time.</p>

<p>Mixed conditions in the remains of a locality are often due to the
presence of different peoples, synchronously or otherwise. This occurs
in many places on the outskirts of this district, a good illustration being
found in East Tennessee, where three or four distinct groups of ware
are intermingled. As would naturally be expected, the distribution is
governed somewhat by the great water-ways, and pottery of this province
is found far up the Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas Rivers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">How Found.</span>&mdash;All peoples have resorted, at some period of their history,
to the practice of burying articles of use or value with the dead.
It is to this custom that we owe the preservation of so many entire
pieces of these fragile utensils. They are exhumed from burial mounds
in great numbers, and to an equal extent, perhaps, from simple, unmarked
graves which are constantly being brought to light by the
plowshare. Fragmentary ware is found also in refuse heaps, on
house and village sites, and scattered broadcast over the face of the
land.</p>

<p>This pottery, at its best, was probably not greatly superior in hardness
to our own soft earthenware, and the disintegrating agencies of
the soil have often reduced it to a very fragile state. Some writer
has expressed the belief that a considerable portion of the ware of this
province was sun-baked merely. This view is hardly a safe one, however,
as clay, unmixed with lime or other like indurating ingredient,
no matter how long exposed to the rays of the sun, would, from ages
of contact with the moist earth, certainly return to its original condition.
I have seen but few pieces that, even after the bleaching
of centuries, did not show traces of the dark mottlings that result from
imperfect firing. There probably was a period of unbaked clay preceding
the terra-cotta epoch, but we cannot expect to find definite traces
of its existence except, perhaps, in cases where large masses, such as
mounds or fortifications, were employed.</p>

<p>The relations of the various articles of pottery to the bodies with
which they were associated seem to be quite varied. The position of
each vessel was determined by its contents, by its symbolic use, or by
the pleasure of the depositor. Uniformity cannot be expected in this
more than in other features of burial. In other sections of the country
the pieces of pottery are said to have been broken before final inhumation
took place, but such was certainly not the practice in this province.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>[page 371]</span>

<p><span class="sc">Age.</span>&mdash;There can be no reasonable doubt that the manufacture of
this ware began many centuries before the advent of the white race,
but it is equally certain that the art was extensively practiced until
quite recent times. The early explorers of Louisiana saw it in use, and
the processes of manufacture are described by Dumont and others.</p>

<p>Possibly Du Pratz had in mind some of the identical vessels now upon
our museum shelves when he said that "the women make pots of an
extraordinary size, jars with a medium-sized opening, bowls, two-pint
bottles with long necks, pots or jugs for containing bear's oil, which
hold as much as forty pints, and finally plates and dishes in the French
fashion."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p class="footnote">Footnote 1: Du Pratz: Histoire de la Louisiane, Vol. II, p. 179.</p>
<p>Vessels were certainly made in great numbers by the Natchez and
other tribes within our period, and it is reasonable to suppose that they
belonged to the great group under discussion. If not, it will be necessary
to seek the cause of their total disappearance, since, as I have already
said, the pottery of this district, as shown by the relics, is practically
a unit.</p>

<p>The introduction of metal utensils was a death-blow to the native industry,
although some of the southern tribes, the Cherokees, for example,
seem to have practiced the art continuously, in a very limited way,
down to the present time. There is but little evidence of the influence
of the art of the whites upon the ceramic products of this province,
although the forms are sometimes thought to be suggestive of European
models. It is certain, however, that the art had reached its highest
stage without the aid of civilized hands, and in the study of its many
interesting features we can feel assured that we are dealing with purely
aboriginal ideas.</p>

<p>The pottery of this province is remarkably homogeneous in character,
and we are warranted in assigning it to a single period of culture, and,
in concluding, that the peoples who developed and practiced the art belonged
to a group of closely-allied tribes. We can also state without
fear of precipitating a controversy that the people who made this pottery
were "mound-builders." At the same time, they were not necessarily
of the same people as the builders of the mounds of Wisconsin,
Ohio, or Georgia or contemporaneous with them.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Use.</span>&mdash;It is difficult to determine the functions of the various forms
of vessels. We are safe in stating that in very primitive times nearly
all were intended for use in the domestic arts, and that as time went on
uses were differentiated&mdash;form, as a consequence, undergoing many
changes. Early writers on the Southern States mention a number of
ordinary uses, such as cooking, the carrying and boiling of water, the
manufacture of sugar and salt, and the preservation of honey, oil, and
paint.</p>

<p>Only a small percentage of the vessels, and these generally of the
pot-shaped variety, show indications of use over fire. It is well known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>[page 372]</span>
that with most peoples particular forms were devoted to especial ceremonial
uses. The construction of vases exclusively for mortuary purposes
was probably not generally practiced, although a few examples,
notably those illustrated in Figs. 372 and 420, point decidedly in this
direction.</p>

<p>The simple conditions of life with these people are indicated by the
absence of certain forms. Lamps, whistles, toys, bricks, tiles, and other
articles in common use with many barbaric nations, are not found in this
province. Pipes, so neatly shaped by other mound-building peoples, are
here of a very rude character, a point indicating decided distinctions between
the tribes of this province and those of neighboring sections.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Construction</span>.&mdash;The methods of manufacture have evidently been
of a primitive character. The wheel or lathe has not been used. At
the advent of the whites, the natives were observed to build their vessels
by a process known as "coiling," and by modeling over gourds,
and over blocks of wood and masses of indurated clay shaped for the
purpose.</p>

<p>It is probable that in many cases the support was not a mold in
the ordinary sense, but was simply a rounded object of small size held
in one hand while the base of the vessel was formed over it by the
other. Rounded pebbles, or the mushroom-shaped objects of clay sometimes
found in the mounds, would have served the purpose perfectly.
Trowels, paddles, stamps, polishing-stones, and other implements were
used in finishing.</p>

<p>Baskets were also used as molds, and pliable fabrics, such as nets
and coarse cloths, were employed in some sections. The methods of
baking have apparently not been described in much detail by early
writers, but the ware itself bears the marks of those simple processes
known to our modern tribes. It is highly probable that the work was
done by the women, and that each community had its skilled potters,
who built and baked the ware in the open air, going through those
simple mummeries that accompany the work among most primitive
peoples.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Material</span>.&mdash;The material employed was usually a moderately fine-grained
clay, tempered, in a great majority of cases, with pulverized
shells. The shells used were doubtless obtained from the neighboring
rivers. In many of the vessels the particles are large, measuring as
much as one-fourth or even one-half of an inch in width, but in the
more elegant vases the shell has been reduced to a fine powder. Powdered
potsherds were also used. The clay was, apparently, often
impure or loamy. It was, probably, at times, obtained from recent
alluvial deposits of the bayous&mdash;the sediment of overflows&mdash;as was the
potter's clay of the Nile. There is no reason for believing that the
finer processes of powdering and levigation were known. A slip or
wash of very finely comminuted clay was sometimes applied to the
surface of the vessel. The walls of the vessels are often thick and uneven,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>[page 373]</span>
and are always quite porous, a feature of no little importance in
the storage of drinking-water, but one resulting from accident rather
than from design.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Color</span>.&mdash;The paste of this ware presents two marked varieties of
color, a dark and a light hue. In a majority of cases it is dark, ranging
from a rich black to all shades of brown and gray. The lighter tints
are usually warm ochrey grays, rarely approaching reddish or terra-cotta
hues. It is highly probable that the differences of color were, to
some extent, intentionally produced, and that the material or methods
of firing were regulated in a way to produce one tint or another at pleasure.
This theory is confirmed by the fact that certain forms of vases
are pretty generally dark, while certain other forms are as uniformly
light&mdash;the latter in nearly all cases being used for the application of
color, or of designs in color.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Form</span>.&mdash;This ware exhibits a great variety of forms, many of which
are extremely pleasing. In this respect it is far superior to the other
prehistoric groups of the eastern United States. The shapes are as
varied and elegant as those of the ancient Pueblo pottery, but are inferior
to those of Mexico, Central America, and Peru. They take a higher
rank than the prehistoric wares of central and northern Europe, but as
a matter of course lack the symmetry and refinement of outline that
characterize the wheel-made wares of Mediterranean countries.</p>

<p>As I classify by form farther on, and discuss the origin of form as
each form-group is presented, I shall not make further reference to this
topic here.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Finish</span>.&mdash;The finish, as compared with the work of civilized nations,
is rude. The surface is often simply hand or trowel smoothed. Generally,
however, it was more or less carefully polished by rubbing with
an implement of stone, shell, bone, or other suitable substance, the
markings of these tools being distinctly visible. Nothing resembling
a glaze has been found on pieces known to be ancient. The surface
was sometimes washed or coated with a slip or film of fine clay which
facilitated the polishing, and in very many cases a coat of thick red
ocher was applied.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ornament</span>.&mdash;The ancient potter of the middle province has taken
especial delight in the embellishment of his wares, and the devices used
are varied and interesting. They include, first, fanciful modifications
of form; second, relief ornament; third, intaglio figures; and, fourth,
designs in color.</p>

<p><i>Modification of shape</i>.&mdash;It can hardly be claimed that the ancient peoples
of this region had a very refined appreciation of elegance of outline,
yet the simple, essential forms of cups and pots were by no means
satisfactory to them. There are many modifications of shape that indicate
a taste for higher types of beauty, and a constant attempt to realize
them. The &aelig;sthetic sentiment was considerably developed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>[page 374]</span>

<p>There is also a decided tendency toward the grotesque. To such an
extreme have the dictates of fancy been followed, in this respect, that
utility, the true office of the utensil, has often taken a secondary place,
although it is never lost sight of entirely. Bowls have been fashioned
into the shapes of birds, fishes, and reptiles, and vases and bottles into
a multitude of animal and vegetable forms without apparent regard to
convenience. All of these modifications of essential forms were doubtless
looked upon as, in a sense, ornamental. So far as I can determine
they were in no case intended to be humorous.</p>

<p><i>Relief ornament.</i>&mdash;Decorative ideas of a purely conventional character
are often worked out in both low and salient relief. This is generally
accomplished by the addition of nodes and fillets of clay to the plain
surfaces of the vessel. Fillets are applied in various ways over the
body, forming horizontal, oblique, and vertical bands or ribs. When
placed about the rim or base, these fillets are often indented with
the finger or an implement in a way to imitate, rudely, a heavy twisted
cord&mdash;a feature evidently borrowed from basketry. Nodes are likewise
attached in various ways to the neck and body of the vessel. In
some cases the entire surface of the larger vessels is varied by pinching
up small bits of the clay between the nails of the fingers and thumb.
An implement is sometimes used to produce a similar result.</p>

<p><i>Intaglio designs.</i>&mdash;The &aelig;sthetic tendencies of these potters are well
shown by their essays in engraving. They worked with points upon
both the plastic and the sun-dried clay, as well as at times upon the
fire-baked surface. Figures thus produced exhibit a wide range of
artistic achievement. They illustrate all stages of progress from the
most archaic type of ornament&mdash;the use of dots and straight lines&mdash;to
the most elegant combinations of curves; and, finally, to the delineation
of life forms and fanciful conceptions.</p>

<p>Generally, when a blunt implement is employed, the line is produced
by a movement that I shall call <i>trailing</i>, in contradistinction to
<i>incision</i>,
in which a sharp point is used, and <i>excision</i> or <i>excavation</i>, which
is
more easily accomplished with the end of a hollow reed or bone. <i>Impressed</i>
or <i>stamped</i> ornament is of rare occurrence, and anything like
<i>repouss&eacute;e</i> work is practically unknown. The practice of impressing
cords and fabrics was common among many of the northern tribes, and
nets have been used in the manufacture and ornamentation of vases at
many points within this province. The use of stamps, especially prepared,
was in vogue in most of the Gulf States, and to a limited extent
in northern localities.</p>

<p><i>Designs in color.</i>&mdash;The colors used in painting are white, red, brown,
and black, and have generally consisted of thick, opaque, clayey paste,
white or colored with ochers. Occasionally the colors used seem to
have been mere stains. All were probably laid on with coarse brushes
of hair, feathers, or vegetable fiber. The figures are in most cases simple,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>[page 375]</span>
and are applied in broad, bold lines, indicative of a strong talent
for decoration. The forms are, to a great extent, curvilinear, and
embrace meanders, scrolls, circles, and combinations and groupings of
curved lines in great variety. Of rectilinear forms, lozenges, guilloches,
zigzags, and checkers are best known.</p>

<p>The decided prevalence of curved forms is worthy of remark. With
all their fertility of invention, the inhabitants of this valley seem never
to have achieved the rectangular linked meander, or anything more
nearly approaching it than the current scroll or the angular guilloche,
while other peoples, such as the Pueblos of the Southwest and the
ancient nations of Mexico and Peru found in it a chief resource. The
reasons for this, as well as for other peculiarities of the decorative art
of the mound-builders as embodied in pottery, must be sought for in
the antecedent and co&euml;xistent arts of these tribes. These peoples
were certainly not highly accomplished in the textile arts, nor had
they felt the influence of advanced architecture such as that of Mexico.
The influence of such arts inevitably gives rise to angular geometric
figures. Taken as a whole, the remains of the mound-builders
would seem to point to a hyperborean origin for both the people and
their arts.</p>

<p>The origin of decorative ideas, the processes by which they are
acquired by the various arts, and their subsequent mutations of form
and significance are matters of the greatest interest, and a separate
paper will be devoted to their consideration.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Classification of Forms.</span>&mdash;Form cannot be made a satisfactory
basis of classification, yet within a given group of products, defined by
general characters, a classification by shape will be found to facilitate
description. In making such a classification we must distinguish
essential from non-essential features, that is to say, for example,
that bowls must be placed with bowls, bottles with bottles, etc., disregarding
the various fanciful modifications given to rims, necks, and
bodies for the sake of embellishment. To recognize these adventitious
features, which are almost infinite in variety, would be to greatly embarrass
form classification.</p>

<p>There is also another difficulty in the employment of form in
classification&mdash;the
nomenclature is very imperfect. We cannot use Greek
names, as our forms correspond in a very few instances only with the
highly developed forms known to classic art. Our own plain terms, although
defective, are better and far more appropriate. All necessary
correlations of form can readily be made when the comparative study of
the pottery of the world is undertaken.</p>

<p>If we take a full set of these primitive vessels and arrange them in
the order of increasing complexity we have an unbroken series ranging
from the simplest cup to the high-necked bottle with perforated foot or
with tripod. A partial series is shown in the upper line, Fig 361. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>[page 376]</span>
multitude of variations from these outlines are found, a few of which
are suggested in the lower line.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/376a-1236.png"><img src="images/376a-600.png" width="600" height="166" alt="Fig. 361.--Scale of forms." /></a>
<p class="center">Fig. 361.&mdash;Scale of forms.</p></div>

<p>Compound, eccentric, and life forms are given elsewhere.</p>

<p>In deciding upon the order of arrangement for the various form
groups, I shall be governed by what appears to be the natural order
of evolution&mdash;a progress from simple to complex. First then we have
basin-like vessels, such as <i>dishes</i>, <i>cups</i>, and <i>bowls</i>.
Second, vases with
wide mouths and somewhat globular bodies, the larger of which would
be very generally recognized as <i>pots</i>. Third, vases with full bodies and
narrow mouths, such as are often termed <i>jars</i>, but which are as properly
called bottles. Fourth, vessels with high, narrow necks, universally
denominated <i>bottles</i>. Vessels that cannot be grouped with either of
these classes will have to be described in sub-groups, arranged in the
order of their complexity or importance.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Origin of Form.</span>&mdash;The derivation and subsequent mutations of
form will be treated somewhat in detail as the various forms come up,
and a subsequent paper will dwell upon the topic at considerable length.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em;"> BOWLS.</h3>

<p>Basin or bowl-shaped vessels exhibit great diversity of shape and ornament.
In size they range from less than one inch in diameter and
depth to more than twenty inches in diameter and a foot in depth. In
color and finish they are uniform with vessels of the other classes.
Their uses were doubtless chiefly domestic.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/376b-1266.png"><img src="images/376b-600.png" width="600" height="151" alt="Fig. 362.--Forms of bowls." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 362.</span>&mdash;Forms of bowls.</p></div>

<p><span class="sc">Form.</span>&mdash;The forms are greatly varied, as will be seen in Fig. 362.
Many are simply segments of spheres and vary from a shallow saucer
to a hollow perforated globe. Others have elongated, compressed, or
conical bodies, with round or flattened bases. Rectangular and irregular
forms are sometimes found. Stands and legs are but rarely attached,
and handles, excepting those of a grotesque character, are exceptional.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>[page 377]</span>

<p>It will probably be safe to assume that some form of shallow vessel&mdash;a
dish, cup, or bowl, was the first artificial form produced. Such a vessel
would be most easily fashioned in clay and may have been suggested
by accident, or by natural or artificial vessels.</p>

<p>Whatever the origin or whichever the method of construction, the
difficulties encountered would at first prevent the manufacture of other
than the simplest forms.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ornament.</span>&mdash;The ornamentation of bowls was accomplished in a
variety of ways. These have been already described in a general way,
under the head of ornament. Rim modifications constitute an important
feature. The margin or lip may be square, oblique, round, or
grooved, as indicated in Fig. 363 <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>.
The scallop may be
employed as in <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>, and relief ornament may be added, such as
fillets
and nodes, and various horizontal projections, as shown in the
second line, Fig. 363, to say nothing of incised lines and indentations,
which are the heritage of wicker-work.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/377-1050.png"><img src="images/377-600.png" width="600" height="325" alt="Fig. 363.--Modification of rims." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 363.</span>&mdash;Modification of rims.</p></div>

<p>Not satisfied with these simple ideas of decoration, the fancy of the
potter led him to add embellishments of most varied and often of extraordinary
character. The nodes and ridges have been enlarged and
prolonged, and fashioned into a thousand natural and fanciful forms.
Shells, fish, birds, beasts, human and impossible creatures have been
utilized in a multitude of ways. Many illustrations of these are given
on subsequent pages.</p>

<p>The body of the bowl is somewhat less profusely ornamented than the
rim. The interior, as well as the exterior, has received painted, relieved,
and intaglio designs. In the painted ones the favorite idea for the interior
is a series of volutes, in broad lines, radiating from the center of
the basin. Groups of festooned lines, either painted or engraved, and
arranged to give the effect of imbricate scales, form also a favorite motive.
The exterior surface of the incurved rims of globular vessels
offers a tempting surface to the artist and is often tastefully decorated
in all the styles.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>[page 378]</span>

<p><span class="sc">Illustrations.</span>&mdash;<i>Ordinary forms.</i>&mdash;I have not thought it necessary
to present many cuts of simple undecorated vessels, as their shapes are
repeated numberless times in elaborated forms. The crude examples
teach nothing as to stage of culture. They are of the same time and
people as the finer specimens.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/378a-450.png"><img src="images/378a-200.png" width="200" height="178" alt="Fig. 364.--Bowl: Arkansas.&mdash;1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 364.</span>&mdash;Bowl: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>The small bowl given in Fig. 364 is unusually well made, and is peculiar
in having its interior surface decorated with a rather chaste incised
design consisting of festooned lines. This was a favorite idea with
the ancient potters and may be seen on both exterior and interior
surfaces of a variety of vessels. The rim is beveled on the inner edge
and has a beaded or indented fillet encircling the outer margin. The
bottom is somewhat flattened. This specimen is from Arkansas.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/378b-648.png"><img src="images/378b-200.png" width="200" height="113" alt="Fig. 365.--Bowl: Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 365.</span>&mdash;Bowl: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>In Fig. 365 we have a good example of the dark, nicely-finished ware
of Arkansas. The widely expanding rim is neatly scalloped on the
margin and is finished on the inside with a pattern of incised lines.
These lines appear to have been engraved in the hardened clay. The
form is rendered graceful by a shallow encircling depression or groove
at the base of the rim. The bottom is somewhat flattened.</p>

<p>Occasionally we find very deep bowls with sloping sides and flat bottoms
resembling our common flower pots. One example from Arkansas
is seven inches in diameter at the top and four at the base, and five
inches deep. A heavy band of clay has been added to the outer margin
of the rim, leaving a channel above and beneath. A number of perforations
occur in this rim, as if made for the passage of thongs or filaments.
A similar specimen of larger dimensions may be seen in the National
Museum.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>[page 379]</span>

<p>We have a number of bowls with incurved rims. This form is more
characteristic of the south and is common along the Gulf coast.</p>

<p>A very small example is shown in Fig. 366. The lower part of the
body is nearly hemispherical while the rim contracts slightly, giving a
rather graceful outline. The exterior is embellished with a simple figure
consisting of four linked scrolls which have been traced with a blunt
point in the moist clay.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/379a-300.png"><img src="images/379a-100.png" width="100" height="62" alt="Fig. 366.--Cup: Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 366.</span>&mdash;Cup: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>A much larger vessel resembling the above in shape is given in Fig.
367. It is of the dark brownish shell-tempered ware, characteristic of
Arkansas. The lip is much incurved and the base considerably flattened,
so that the form is that of a greatly compressed oblate spheroid.
The outer surface has been moderately well polished, and is ornamented
in a very effective manner by a series of figures, outlined by incised
lines, alternate spaces being filled in with minute punctures.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/379b-768.png"><img src="images/379b-300.png" width="300" height="197" alt="Fig. 367.--Bowl: Arkansas. (?)--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 367.</span>&mdash;Bowl: Arkansas. (?)&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>A favorite form is a bowl with full deep body and incurved lip. A
vessel of this class is illustrated in Fig. 368. The rim is but slightly
incurved,
while the body is considerably constricted below the greatest
circumference. It is a unique and handsome specimen. The color of
the slip is a pale, reddish-gray, a little darker than an ordinary flesh
tint. The paste is seen to be yellowish where the surface has been injured.
The ornament is a simple meander, consisting of three incised
lines. It is said to have been found in Arkansas. Other bowls of like
form and of elegant finish are found in the collection. They are generally
dark in color, and have large apertures, low walls and flattened
bases. The meander, mostly in its more simple forms, is the favorite
decoration.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>[page 380]</span>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/380a-744.png"><img src="images/380a-300.png" width="300" height="213" alt="Fig. 368.--Bowl: Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 368.</span>&mdash;Bowl: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>There are many red vessels of the class under consideration, but the
majority are less contracted at the aperture and thus are somewhat pot-shaped.
They are rather rudely constructed and finished, and but for
the color, would seem to be intended for ordinary cooking purposes. I
observe in a number of cases that circular medallion-like ornaments have
been set around the rim. These are from one-half to one inch in diameter,
and are generally perforated or punctured in two or three places,
apparently with the idea of representing a face. The effect is very much
like that of the small perforated disks, riveted upon the exterior of copper
or tin kettles for the purpose of attaching handles. Occasionally
a tail-like appendage is added to the under side of these discoidal heads,
suggesting the tadpole figures upon the sacred water vessels of the
Pueblo Indians.</p>

<p>One large basin with slightly incurved rim has a series of triangular
figures in red and brown upon both the inner and the outer surfaces.
It is rudely finished and of large size, being eleven inches in diameter
and seven and a half in height.</p>

<p><i>Eccentric forms.</i>&mdash;Before proceeding with the discussion of life-forms
as exhibited in bowls, I must present a few unique shapes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/380b-1092.png"><img src="images/380b-600.png" width="600" height="112" alt="Fig. 369., Fig. 370. Cups: Arkansas (?).--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center" style="width: 500px"><span style="float: left"><span class="sc">Fig. 369.</span></span>
<span style="float: right"><span class="sc">Fig. 370.</span></span></p> <p class="center">Cups: Arkansas (?).&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>These consist of ladle-shaped vessels, and of bowls or basins with
rectangular, oval, or unsymmetrical outlines. Ladles are of rare occurrence.
In the Third Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology I have
illustrated the best example that has come to my notice. The Davenport
collection contains but one specimen&mdash;a rude shallow cup with a
short thick handle. The form suggests the wooden and horn spoons of
the modern tribes and may have originated in their archaic prototypes.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>[page 381]</span>

<p>Fig. 369 illustrates a minute cup rudely made of coarse clay. The
outline is oval and slightly pointed at one end, as if intended for pouring
liquids.</p>

<p>In Fig. 370 we have another small vessel of rude finish with two
pointed lips. A much larger vessel of similar shape may be seen in
the Davenport collection. The projecting pointed lip is rarely found in
aboriginal pottery, although I see no reason why such a feature may
not readily have been suggested to the savage by the prolonged margins
of his vessels of shell.</p>

<p>Rectangular vessels are of the rude shell-tempered ware, and, although
rare, are widely distributed.</p>

<p>Fig. 371 illustrates a specimen from Pecan Point, Arkansas. The surface
is rudely finished and without polish. The color is a dark gray,
much flecked with large particles of white shell. Another example has
a square rim but a rounded bottom, and is covered with a coat or slip of
dark red clay.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/381-624.png"><img src="images/381-250.png" width="250" height="197" alt="Fig. 371.--Rectangular bowl: Pecan Point,--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 371.</span>&mdash;Rectangular bowl: Pecan Point,
Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>A small vessel from the same region as the preceding has the rim
pressed in on the four sides, leaving sharp, projecting corners.</p>

<p>One of the most notable vessels in the collection is illustrated in Fig.
372. It is a heavy casket consisting of two parts, body and lid, and is
made as usual of clay and coarsely pulverized shell. It is brownish gray
in color and bears some marks of the baking. It was obtained by Captain
W. P. Hall from a low mound at Hale's Point, Tennessee, and is described
by Mr. W. H. Pratt, in the following language: "It is of rude,
irregular, quadrangular form, made in two parts. The lower, or case
proper, is 12 inches long, 7 inches wide, and 5 inches deep, inside
measure, the upper edge being slightly bent inward all around. The
upper part or lid is of similar form and dimensions, being very slightly
larger, so as to close down over the other part, about one and a half
inches, and is somewhat more shallow. As the lid does not fit very perfectly,
the joint around the edge had been plastered up with clay.
When found, it contained the remains of a very small child reduced to
dust, except that some of the bones of the skull, jaws, and limbs retained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>[page 382]</span>
their form, crumbling rapidly, however, upon removal and exposure to
the air. There were also found two or three dozen small shell beads.
Excepting the remains described, the case was entirely empty. The
case weighs six and a quarter, and the lid just six pounds." This is
one of the very few vessels that would seem to have been constructed
especially for mortuary purposes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/382-1020.png"><img src="images/382-400.png" width="400" height="395" alt=" Fig. 372.--Burial casket: Hale's Point, Tennessee.--1/4." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc"> Fig. 372.</span>&mdash;Burial casket: Hale's Point, Tennessee.&mdash;&frac14;.</p></div>

<p>I wish to add to the list of eccentric forms a singular example from
the collection of J. R. Thibault, of Little Rock, Arkansas. As shown
in Fig. 373 it is an oblong, trough-like vessel with flat projecting wings
at the ends. It is extremely well-finished, with thin walls, symmetrical
form, and high polish. The color is quite dark and the material is as
usual. The engraved design consists of incised lines, which form a
number of rectangular compartments extending around the exterior surface
of the body. The wings are perforated. The form of this vessel
suggests the wooden trays of some modern tribes. A similar example,
which is illustrated in the Third Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology,
is of much inferior interest, being plain and rude.</p>

<p><i>Life forms.</i>&mdash;A very large percentage of the bowls of this district are
modified in such a way as to resemble, more or less closely, the form of
some living creature&mdash;bird, beast, or reptile. Especial attention has
been given to the heads. These are modeled in the round and attached
to the rim or side, while other parts of the animal appear upon different
portions of the vessel.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>[page 383]</span>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/383-1266.png"><img src="images/383-600.png" width="600" height="202" alt="Fig. 373.--Trough-shaped vessel: Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>

<p class="center">[<i>National Museum.</i>]</p></div>

<p>It will be difficult to determine the origin of this curious practice.
We shall not be able to say that it came from the elaboration of handles,
simply to please fancy, for the reason that vessels of this class are
rarely known to have had simple handles; nor from the modification of
simple ornaments, as such were but little used. It is still less probable
that animal forms were first modeled independently, and afterwards
changed in such a way as to serve as vessels. There are no examples
of animal forms in clay independent of vessels. It would not be consistent
with primitive methods of procedure to copy nature direct, at
least until some mystic significance had become attached to the form
employed. It is possible, however, that the origin of this practice is
not to be found within the plastic art itself, but in the shapes of antecedent
and co-existent vessels of other materials in which life forms had
been employed; or in the use of natural objects themselves as utensils,
the original forms not having been lost sight of and having in time suggested
the employment of other natural forms. Examples of the latter
class may be cited.</p>

<p>Shells were primitive vessels. The hard cases of seeds and fruits were
also much used. These were doubtless antecedent to vessels of clay.
They were the natural models for the potter, the carver in wood or
stone, and their employment as such served to lead up gradually to a
more realistic and general use of natural shapes in works of art to
which they were not essential features. The importance of the various
animal forms was increased by their association with religious ideas.
Nearly all the vessels of this class presented in the following illustrations
come from the vicinity of Pecan Point, Arkansas.</p>

<p>Clay vessels imitating both marine and fresh-water shells are occasionally
obtained from the mounds and graves of the Mississippi Valley.
The conch shell appears to have been a favorite model, especially in its
modified form, Fig. 374, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. The clam shell is also imitated
in <i>c</i> and
<i>d</i>. The more conventional forms of these vessels are exceedingly
interesting,
as they point out the tendencies and possibilities of modification.
An instructive example illustrated in <i>e</i> has four groups of nodes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>[page 384]</span>
each, consisting of a large central node with four or five smaller ones,
surrounding it, set about the rim, the conception being that of four
shells joined in one vessel, with the noded apexes turned outward and
the bases inward.</p>

<p>A still more highly conventionalized form is shown in <i>f</i>. The
cup is unsymmetrical in outline, and has a few imperfect nodes near one corner,
but its resemblance to a shell would hardly be recognized by one
unacquainted with more realistic renderings of like subjects. In <i>g</i> we
have an imitation of a shell cup placed within a plain cup.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/384a-1278.png"><img src="images/384a-600.png" width="600" height="242" alt="Fig. 374.--Clay vessels imitating shells." /></a>
 <p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 374.</span>&mdash;Clay vessels imitating shells.</p></div>

<p>A very good illustration of this class of vessel is given in Fig. 375. It is
evidently intended to imitate a trimmed conch shell. The apex and a few
of the surrounding nodes are shown at the right, while the base or spine
forms a projecting lip at the left. A coil of clay forms the apex. This
is carried outward in a sinistral spiral to the noded shoulder. We have
here a suggestion of the origin of a favorite decorative motive, the
scroll, a clew, however, which the paucity of examples makes it difficult
to follow up satisfactorily.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 375.</span>&mdash;Bowl imitating a modified conch shell.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>Although we may not be able to arrive at any definite conclusion in
regard to the origin and significance of the practice of modeling life
forms in clay, we are certain of one thing, that it became an important
feature in the potter's art, and that in due course of time the practice
broke loose from the restraints of birth and tradition and asserted its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>[page 385]</span>
freedom in the production of any form that superstition or fancy happened
to select.</p>

<p>The artist probably did not follow nature with great accuracy in all the
details of species and varieties, but some definite model must have been
in view, in nearly all cases, and such characters as came to be regarded
as essential to that creature were never lost sight of, consistency
being a most notable characteristic of the art of a savage or barbaric
people.</p>

<p>The sun-fish was a favorite model, but its form was generally employed
in vessels with upright necks. A number of examples occur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>[page 386]</span>
in the next section. Of reptilian forms the frog seems to have been
the favorite.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 380.</span>&mdash;Bird-shaped bowl: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>Few examples occur, however, in the shallower vessels. In the bowl
illustrated in Fig. 376, the various members of the body are boldly
modeled, and appear about the most expanded portion of the vessel.
The rim is ornamented with a series of notches, and two small loops
connect the rim with the head and tail of the creature. The legs are
characteristic, and the long toes extend beneath the body. The bottom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>[page 387]</span>
of the vessel is flat. The make and finish are as usual, but the surface
has been painted red. A similar vessel is shown in Fig. 377, the view being
taken from the front. It is well polished and has a rounded bottom.
The color is dark.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 382.</span>&mdash;Bowl with grotesque heads: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>Another remarkable example of this use of animal forms is seen in
the vessel presented in Fig. 378. A deep globular bowl of dark, well-polished
ware is made to represent the head of an animal. A long
snout, with teeth and nostrils and accompanied by a pair of knobs
for eyes, embellishes the right side&mdash;as seen in the cut&mdash;ears appear
at the front and back, and a circular node standing, perhaps, for the
severed neck, is placed at the left. The head has a decidedly porcine
look, yet it may have been intended for a raccoon or an opossum.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>[page 388]</span>

<p>Fig. 379 illustrates a large shallow bowl or pan of ordinary form and
finish. The head of a bird resembling a turkey is attached to one side,
with the bill turned inward. On the opposite side there is a small
handle-like projection that represents the bird's tail.</p>

<p>A vessel of somewhat extraordinary form is shown in Fig. 380. The
bowl is smaller and deeper than the last, and serves as the body of
a bird, the head and tail of which are of unusual proportions. The
neck is very long and thick and is gracefully curved, but the head
is not modeled with sufficient care to make apparent the species intended.</p>

<p>The vessel shown in Fig. 381 is also finished in imitation of a bird.
In this case the bird is placed upon its back, the neck and head being
looped up to form a sort of handle on one side, while the legs answer a
like purpose on the opposite side. The wings are represented by a
number of lines rudely engraved upon the sides of the vessel. The
resemblance of this bowl to the wooden basins made by Northwest
Coast Indians is very striking.</p>

<p>The vessel shown in Fig. 382 is one of the most unique yet brought to
light. It is a heavy, rather rudely finished bowl, to the rim of which
two grotesque heads, apparently of nondescript character, have been
attached. One resembles the oft-occurring plumed serpent of aboriginal
American art in a number of its characters. The other has a double
comb somewhat resembling that of a domestic fowl. No description
can convey as clear a conception of these monstrosities as the accompanying
illustration.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 384.</span>&mdash;Grotesque heads.</p></div>

<p>A good degree of skill is shown in the modeling of varieties of birds.
A fair idea of the accuracy of these potters in this direction will be
conveyed by the series of heads shown in Fig. 383. Several species of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>[page 389]</span>
ducks are apparently differentiated, one of which, resembling the summer
duck closely, is given in <i>a</i>, while the head given in <i>b</i>, although
possibly also intended for a duck, is much like a grouse or partridge.
The pigeon or dove is seen in <i>c</i>, the vulture or eagle in <i>d</i>, and
the owl
in <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine more grotesque and outlandish heads
than those attached to the bowls illustrated in Figs. 385 and 386. The
vessels themselves are of the usual type, rudely modeled and finished
and very heavy. The first is dark in color, the other red. The strange
animal here represented is certainly not a close copy of anything in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>[page 390]</span>
nature. It is characterized by upright ears, a high bulbous snout and
a grinning mouth. The teeth in some cases resemble the fangs of a
serpent. The eyes consist of rounded nodes; and often curved lines,
incised or in relief, extend from them or the mouth down the sides of
the neck. The tail at the opposite end of the vessel is turned upward
and coiled. The type specimens of this form are from Pecan Point,
Arkansas.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>[page 391]</span>

<p>The peculiar character of this class of heads is well shown in the
series given in Fig. 384. My observations have led me to suspect that
they may be the result of attempts to model in clay the mythical plumed
serpent which is so graphically delineated in the engraving upon the
little vase shown in Fig. 407. The fact that in one case legs have been
added to the base of the body militates against this theory. Their resemblance
to the gargoyle heads of medi&aelig;val architecture suggests
the possibility of early European influence.</p>

<p>If possible, a still more novel conceit is embodied in the handle of
the vessel shown in Fig. 387. It can be likened to nothing in nature
more readily than to the antler of an elk. This vessel is of a dark
brownish color, and is but slightly polished. A duplicate specimen of
inferior size and finish has recently been added to the National Museum
from a grave at Pecan Point.</p>

<p>Similar to the preceding in general appearance are a number of bowls
or deep pans, embellished with the heads of animals. A very good
example is given in Fig. 388. The head has a decided resemblance
to that of a female deer or fawn. The tail appears upon the opposite
side of the basin, and is pendant, as in nature. Legs have been
added to the base of the bowl; these terminate beneath the body in
cloven hoofs.</p>

<p>The small bowl, shown in Fig. 389, is nearly hemispherical in shape.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/391-582.png"><img src="images/391-250.png" width="250" height="170" alt="Fig. 389.--Animal-shaped bowl: Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 389.</span>&mdash;Animal-shaped bowl: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>A small head, representing some animal, has been attached to the
rim. The exterior surface is covered with a number of groups of
roughly-worked concentric ridges, which may be meant to imitate hair.
These ridges have apparently been made by pinching up the clay between
the nails of the fingers and thumb. Figures of similar form are
generally incised. This vessel is probably from the vicinity of Pecan
Point.</p>

<p>The creature represented by the head, shown in Fig. 390, would not
be recognized from the cut, or perhaps not even with certainty from
any single specimen, but with a number of examples in view, there
need be no hesitation. The animal intended is a bat. In a number of
features the likeness is striking. The high top head, the angular ears,
and the small eyes crowded down upon the mouth are characteristic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>[page 392]</span>
The tail is flat, curved a little upward, and ridged along the middle
in imitation of the attenuated caudal column. The general consistency
of this work is demonstrated by the fact that this particular form of
tail accompanies this form of head in all cases, and is not associated
with any other. The face of the bat is always turned toward the vessel;
in imitation of other varieties of animals, it is nearly always turned out.</p>

<p>In one case, Fig. 391, we have, what appears to be, a human head
attached to the side of the bowl. This head is furnished with a triangular
crest, notched on the edges, and enlarged at the top. The case
is a perplexing one, especially as a tail like that attached to the bird
bowls occurs on the side opposite the head.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em;"> POT-SHAPED VESSELS.</h3>

<p>There is no hard line of demarcation between the class of vessels now
to be considered and those already described. The distinction is made
chiefly for convenience of treatment.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>[page 393]</span>

<p><span class="sc">Material, etc.</span>&mdash;As a rule, pot-shaped vessels are of coarser materials
and of ruder finish than other forms, indicating, perhaps, their
exclusive relegation to the culinary arts, where nice finish was not essential.
In many cases they show use over fire.</p>

<p>In size, they have a wide range. The larger are often as much as
fifteen inches in diameter, and twenty in height. There are a score or
more of very large size in the Davenport museum.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Form.</span>&mdash;The form characteristics are a full globular body&mdash;sometimes
elongated, sometimes compressed vertically&mdash;a low neck, and a wide
aperture. The bottom is very generally rounded. A few of the form
modifications are shown in Fig. 392. The rim or neck is always short,
and is upright or slightly recurved. Many vessels resembling the shapes
here presented are placed with the succeeding group, as they appear to
be functionally distinct from this. There are no examples with legs or
stands.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/393a-1212.png"><img src="images/393a-600.png" width="600" height="98" alt="Fig. 392.--Forms of pots." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 392.</span>&mdash;Forms of pots.</p></div>

<p><span class="sc">Handles.</span>&mdash;Looped handles are confined almost wholly to this class
of vessels. They are generally ranged about the rim or neck. In a majority
of cases there are four handles to a vessel. We rarely find less
than that number, but often more. It is a usual thing to see fifteen or
twenty handles set about the rim. Originally the handles may have
been exclusively functional in character; they were so at least in antecedent
forms. These potters have certainly, at times, employed them
for purposes of embellishment. In some cases they are too fragile for
use, in others they are flattened out against the neck of the vessel and
united with it throughout their whole length. Again, they have degenerated
into mere ridges, notched and otherwise modified to suit the fancy.
In many instances their place is taken by incised lines or indentations
which form effective and appropriate ornamental figures. A series of
vessels showing gradations from perfect handles to their atrophied
representatives
is shown in Fig. 393.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/393b-1218.png"><img src="images/393b-600.png" width="600" height="142" alt="Fig. 393.--Handles." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 393.</span>&mdash;Handles.</p></div>

<p><span class="sc">Origin of Handles.</span>&mdash;Handles were doubtless originally attached
to facilitate the suspension and handling of vessels and other articles.
They probably had their typical development in basketry, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>[page 394]</span>
are good reasons for supposing that certain forms of the handles upon
pottery owe their existence to contact with the sister art. This idea
is confirmed by their shapes, and by the fact that a large percentage
of the pottery handles are useless as aids to suspension or transportation.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ornament.</span>&mdash;Rim margins are modified for decorative purposes, very
much as they are in bowls. See Fig. 363.</p>

<p>The bodies of these vessels are often elaborately ornamented, mostly
by incised figures, but often by punctures, nodes and ribs. The incised
lines are arranged principally in groups of straight lines forming angular
figures&mdash;a very archaic style&mdash;and in groups of festooned lines so
placed as to resemble scales. The punctures are made with a sharp
point, and form encircling lines and various carelessly executed patterns.
A rude sort of ornamentation is produced by pinching up the
soft clay of the surface between the nails of the fingers and thumb.
Relief ornament consists chiefly of applied fillets of clay, arranged to
form vertical ribs. Rows of nodes are sometimes seen, and in a few
cases the whole body is covered with rude nodes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Illustrations.</span>&mdash;The specimens selected for illustration are intended
to epitomize the forms and decorations of a very great number of vessels,
and are not always the most showy examples to be found.</p>

<p>A vessel of rather exceptional shape is given in Fig. 394. It could
as well be classed with bowls as with pots. The ware is of the rude
kind generally used over the fire. The body is high and cylindrical,
the rim flaring, and the bottom quite flat. The form is suggestive of
our domestic crockery.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 394.</span>&mdash;Pot: Arkansas (?).&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>Another bowl-like pot is illustrated in Fig. 395. It is of the dark,
rudely hand-polished variety. The body is globular, the neck is very
short and is ornamented with a dentate band. Below this are two
pairs of perforations, probably used for suspending the vessel. There
are a number of vessels of this variety, mostly smaller than the example
given.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>[page 395]</span>

<p>The vessel shown in Fig. 396 is still more pot-like. The neck is higher
than the preceding and is slightly constricted. It is of very rude construction
and finish. The rim is furnished with two small horizontal
projections, and the body is somewhat obscurely lobed. It represents
a very numerous class, especially plentiful in Southeast Missouri.</p>

<p>The little pot presented in Fig. 397 has the body covered with rude
nodes. The neck is surrounded by a heavy fillet, notched obliquely in
imitation of a twisted cord. Four rude handles have also been attached.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="images/395b-1326.png"><img src="images/395b-600.png" width="600" height="214" alt="Fig. 397.--Pot: Arkansas (?).--1/3; Fig. 398.--Pot: Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>

<p>In Fig. 398 we have one of the rudest examples in the collection.
The neck is furnished with four handles, which alternate with four vertical
ribs. The body is misshapen and rough, and is ornamented with
a series of nearly vertical ridges, a rather usual device, and one which
is sometimes very neatly executed.</p>

<p>The body of the nicely finished pot shown in Fig. 399 is embellished
with short, incised markings, arranged in vertical lines. The neck is
furnished with a heavy indented band and four strong handles. The
locality given is "Four-Mile Bayou, Alabama."</p>

<p>The specimen given in Fig. 400 illustrates the use of great numbers
of handles. In this case there are sixteen. They are gracefully formed
and add much to the appearance of the vessel, which is really a bowl
with wide, flaring rim. In most of its characters it resembles the pots.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>[page 396]</span>

<p>Another curious variation in the shape of handles is shown in the
little cup given in Fig. 401. This can hardly be called a usual feature,
although occurring in vessels of various localities. I have seen an example
from the Missouri Valley in which a great number of perforated
handles were set about the rim, and another in which there was a continuous,
partially free, collar perforated at intervals. There is a specimen
of this class in the Davenport Academy collection in which the
flattened handles are so placed about the neck as to form a series of
arches. These, I take it, are partially atrophied forms. The body is
ornamented by a scale-like pattern of incised lines&mdash;a favorite method
of decoration with the ancient potter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="images/396b-1206.png"><img src="images/396b-600.png" width="600" height="209" alt="Fig. 401.--Pot: Arkansas (?).--1/3; Fig. 402.--Pot: Arkansas (?).--1/3." /></a>

<p>In Fig. 402 we have an illustration of total atrophy. The handles
are represented by simple incised lines. There is no relief whatever.
In many cases the form of the handles is shown in low relief, the outer
surface being plain or ornamented with incised lines or punctures.
The body of the vessel last mentioned is covered with rudely incised
scroll designs.</p>

<p>Another good illustration of this class of vessels is shown in Fig. 403.</p>

<p>The cut is taken from my paper in the Third Annual Report of the
Bureau of Ethnology. The handles are indicated by incised lines.
The body was ornamented by pinching up the clay between the nails
of the thumb and forefinger. Locality: Pecan Point, Arkansas.</p>

<p>A good example of the larger pots is illustrated in Fig. 404. It is
engraved a little less than one-fourth the dimensions of the original.
The height is seventeen inches and the greatest diameter eighteen inches.
It is very well made. The walls are even and only moderately thick.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>[page 398]</span>
The dark, unpolished surface is profusely speckled with fragments of
white shell. There are four wide, strong handles. The rim and neck
are ornamented with encircling lines of finger-nail indentations.</p>

<p>A masterpiece of this class of work is shown in Fig. 405. It was obtained
at Pecan Point. It is not quite symmetrical in form but is
carefully finished. The color is gray, with mottlings of dark spots, the
result of firing. The height is eleven inches, and the aperture is ten
inches in diameter. There are ten strong, well-proportioned handles,
each having a knob resembling a rivet head, near the upper end. The
margin of the rim has a circle of indentations. There are a few red vessels
of this shape which have figures of reptiles attached to the neck.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em;"> WIDE-MOUTHED BOTTLES OR JARS.</h3>

<p>Vessels of this class were probably not devoted to the ordinary uses
of cooking and serving food. They are handsome in shape, tasteful in
decoration, and generally of small dimensions. They are found, as are
all other forms, buried with the dead, placed by the head or feet, or
within reach of the hands. Their appearance is not suggestive of their
original office, as there is no indication of wear, or of use over fire.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Form.</span>&mdash;I include under this head a series of forms reaching from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>[page 399]</span>
the wide-mouthed pot to the well-developed bottle. They really correspond
closely to the high-necked bottles in all respects save in height
of neck, and the separation is therefore for convenience of treatment
only. The following illustration (Fig. 406) will give a good idea of the
forms included.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 406.</span>&mdash;Forms of jar-shaped bottles.</p></div>

<p>There are also many eccentric and many extremely interesting life
forms included in this group. A number of vases, modeled after the
human head, are, by their general outline, properly included.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ornamentation.</span>&mdash;The rims, bodies, and bases are embellished much
after the fashion of the vessels already described, with the exception
that handles or handle-like appendages or ornaments seldom appear.
The painted designs are in one, two, or three colors, and the incised
figures have been executed both in the soft and in the thoroughly dried clay.</p>

<p>The style of execution is often of a very high order, especially in some
of the more southerly examples, a number of which are from the mounds
of Mississippi and Louisiana. We note the fact that in a few of the
designs there is a slight suggestion of Mexican forms.</p>

<p>In illustrating this group, I am compelled, for the want of space to
omit many interesting examples. I present only such as seem to me
especially instructive.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Illustrations.</span>&mdash;<i>Ordinary forms.</i>&mdash;The vessel shown in Fig. 407
may
be taken as a type of a very large class. It is most readily described
as a short-necked, wide-mouthed bottle. It is symmetrical in shape
and very nicely finished. The lip is supplied with a narrow, horizontal
rim. The body expands somewhat abruptly from the base of the upright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>[page 400]</span>
neck to the squarish shoulder, and contracts below in an even
curve, giving a hemispherical base. There are a multitude of variations
from this outline, a few of which are suggested in Fig. 406. These
vessels are nearly all of the dark, grayish-brown, fire-mottled ware. A
few are yellowish, and such are often painted red or decorated with
designs in red and white.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/400a-350.png"><img src="images/400a-300.png" width="300" height="247" alt="Fig. 408.--Bottle: Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 409.</span>&mdash;Bottle: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>Two charming vases are shown in Figs. 408 and 409. The surface
finish is in both cases very superior. The lines of the figures are carefully
drawn, and seem to have been produced by the trailing, under
even pressure, of a smooth rather blunt point. It is difficult to get so
nicely finished and even a line by simple incision, or by excavating the
clay. The design in Fig. 408 consists of eight groups of curved lines
arranged in pairs, which are separated by plain vertical bands. It might
be considered an interrupted or imperfectly connected form of the running
scroll. This grouping of lines is frequently met with in the decorative
designs of the Southern States. The design upon the other
vase, Fig. 409, is still more characteristic of the South. It consists of
an encircling row of round, shallow indentations, about which series
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>[page 401]</span>
of incised scrolls are linked, and of two additional rows of depressions,
one above and the other below, through which parallel lines are drawn.</p>

<p>Many other interesting illustrations of the simpler forms could be
given, but nearly all are very similar in their more important features
to the examples that precede or follow.</p>

<p>As skilled as these peoples were in modeling life forms, and in engraving
geometric devices, they seem rarely to have attempted the linear representation
of life forms. We have, however, two very good examples.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/401a-582.png"><img src="images/401a-200.png" width="200" height="161" alt="Fig. 410.--Engraved bottle: Arkansas." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 410.</span>&mdash;Engraved bottle: Arkansas.</p></div>

<p>The first of these is shown in outline in Fig. 410. It is a large bottle
embellished with four rude drawings of the human figure, executed
with a sharp point in the soft clay. Height of vessel, eight inches.</p>

<p>The work is characteristic of a very early stage of art. The figures
could be duplicated in the work of the ancient Pueblos, and in the pictographic
art of many of our savage tribes. They are probably derived
from symbolic art, and possibly relate to the guardians of the four
points of the compass, or to some similar mythical characters.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 412.</span><br />&mdash;Engraved design.&mdash;&frac12;.</p></div>

<p>The work upon the neat little bottle, presented in Fig. 411, is of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>[page 402]</span>
same class as the above but of a much higher grade, both in execution
and conception. The engraved design
is one of the most remarkable ever obtained
from the mounds. It consists of
two winged and crested rattlesnakes,
which encircle the most expanded part
of the vessel, and of two sunflower-like
figures, alternating with them. These
designs are very carefully engraved with
a needle-like point, and are adjusted to
the form of the vase in a way that suggests
forethought and an appreciation
of the decorative value of the figures.
By dint of rubbings, photographs and
sketches, I have obtained the complete
drawing of the various figures which are
given in Fig. 412 on a scale of one-half
the original.</p>

<p>The serpent, especially the rattlesnake,
has always taken a leading place
in the mythology and the art of the more
cultured American races, and crest-plumes,
and wings have often been considered
its proper attributes. The conventional
method of representation is
also characteristically aboriginal. The
plumes, the figure connected with the
eye, the bands upon the neck, the
stepped figures of the body, and the
semi-circular patches on the wings are
all characters that appear again and
again in the ancient art of the United
States. The peculiar emblematic treatment
of the heart is almost universal in
temperate North America. And just
here I may be permitted to suggest that
the remarkable feature of the great
earth-work serpent of Adams county,
Ohio, which has been regarded as the
"symbolic egg," and which in its latest
phase has become the issue of a frog
and the prey of the serpent, is possibly
intended for the heart of the serpent,
the so-called frog being the head. The
rosette figures are not often duplicated
in Indian art. There can be little doubt that the figures of this design
are derived from mythology.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>[page 403]</span>

<p><i>Eccentric forms.</i>&mdash;A form of vessel of which civilized men make peculiar
use is depicted in Fig. 413. There is a marked resemblance to a
common tea-pot. A very few examples have been found, two of which
are illustrated in the Third Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology.
The specimen here given is well made and carefully finished.
The neck is low and wide, and the body is a compressed sphere. The
spout is placed upon one side and a low knob upon the other. The absence
of a handle for grasping indicates that the vessel was probably
not intended for boiling water. These characters are uniform in all the
specimens that have come to my notice. Two small circular depressions
occur on the sides of the vessel alternating with the spout and
the knob and with these features form centers for four rosettes of involute
incised lines. The origin of this form of vessel is suggested by
a fine red piece from "Mississippi," now in the national collection. The
knob is the head of a turtle or other full-bodied reptile, and the spout
takes the place of the creature's tail. Many of the animal-shaped
vases would resemble this form closely if an opening were made through
the top of the body and through the tail.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 414.</span>&mdash;Vessel of eccentric form: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>In connection with the teapot-like vessels it will be well to describe
another novel form not wholly unlike them in appearance, an example
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>[page 404]</span>
being shown in Fig. 414. The shoulder is elongated on opposite sides
into two curved, horn-like cones, which give to the body a somewhat
crescent-shaped outline. It is of the ordinary plain, dark ware, and
has had a low stand or base which is now broken away.</p>

<p>The specimen given in Fig. 415 has been considerably mutilated, but
evidently belongs to the same class as the preceding. It probably also
resembled the vessel which follows; it serves at least as a link between
the two. The body is ornamented with carelessly drawn, deeply incised,
involute designs.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/404a-648.png"><img src="images/404a-300.png" width="300" height="253" alt="Fig. 415.--Vessel of eccentric form: Pecan Point, Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 416.</span>&mdash;Animal-shaped vase: Pecan Point,
Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p><i>Life forms.</i>&mdash;A further elaboration of the preceding forms is illustrated
in Fig. 416. On one side the conical projection is greatly elongated and
fashioned to resemble the head of some grotesque beast, with horns,
expanded nostrils, and grinning mouth. The opposite point is elongated
and looped, forming a tail, while the base of the body is furnished with
four feet. On the sides of the vessel are engraved figures, consisting
of clusters of involute lines, as in the specimen just given. It is of the
ordinary dark pottery, and was obtained at Pecan Point.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>[page 405]</span>

<p>Equally noteworthy as plastic representations are the two examples
that follow. The vessel shown in Fig. 417 is modeled in imitation of a
sunfish. The body is much flattened and is neatly polished. The head is
well modeled, as are also the fins and tail. Many examples of this form
are found, some of which are elaborately treated, the scales being
minutely shown. The body of the fish is sometimes placed in the natural
upright position, the neck of the vessel rising from the back, producing
a lenticular shape.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 417.</span>&mdash;Sunfish vase: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>The animal so carefully modeled in the vessel given in Fig. 418 resembles
a raccoon or an opossum. The mouth of the vessel is wide and
the neck upright and short. The body is ornamented with a pattern
made up of triangular groups of incised lines, which may or may not
be meant for hair.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 418.</span>&mdash;Opossum vase: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8532;.</p></div>

<p>The love of modeling life forms shows itself again in the little vase
illustrated in Fig. 419. The head of some animal, rudely suggested,
projects from one side, while a curved tail on the other carries out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>[page 406]</span>
idea of the complete creature. The round body is decorated with broad
vertical lines in dark red. A red line encircles the rim.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/406-738.png"><img src="images/406-300.png" width="300" height="234" alt="Fig. 419.--Animal-shaped vase: Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 419.</span>&mdash;Animal-shaped vase: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>It is not strange that a people who had successfully engaged in the
modeling of life forms, and especially the heads of animals, should attempt
the human head. Their remarkable success in this direction is
shown in a number of vases, one of which is given in Fig. 420. This
and kindred peoples had made considerable progress in carving in stone
and other materials, evincing a decided talent for sculpture; but clay is
so much more readily manipulated than either wood, stone, or shell,
that we are not surprised to find their best work in that material.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that with all this cleverness in the handling
of clay, and in the delineation of varied models, the art had not freed
itself from the parent stem&mdash;the vessel&mdash;and launched out into an independent
field. In a few cases such an end seems to have been achieved
by certain groups of mound builders, notably those whose works at
Madisonville, Ohio, have recently been explored by Professor Putnam.
Modeling in clay was probably confined to vessels for the reason that,
through their humble agency, the art was developed.</p>

<p>Up to the present time I have met with but eight of these curious
head-shaped vases. All were obtained from the vicinity of Pecan Point,
Arkansas, and, like other vessels, have been associated with human remains
in graves or mounds. It is true that in all cases the bones of the
dead have not been found, but this only indicates their complete decay.
The question as to whether or not these vases were made exclusively
for sepulchral purposes must remain unanswered; there is no source of
information upon the subject. Such a purpose is, however, suggested
in this case by the semblance of death given to the faces.</p>

<p>The finest example yet found is shown in Fig. 420. In form it is a
simple head, five inches in height and five inches wide from ear to ear.
The aperture of the vase is in the crown, and is surrounded by a low,
upright rim, slightly recurved. The cavity is roughly finished, and follows
pretty closely the contour of the exterior surface, excepting in projecting
features such as the ears, lips, and nose. The walls are generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>[page 407]</span>
from one-eighth, to one-fourth of an inch in thickness, the base being
about three-eighths. The bottom is flat, and takes the level of the chin
and jaws.</p>

<p>The material does not differ from that of the other vessels of the same
locality. There is a large percentage of shell, some particles of which
are quite large. The paste is yellowish gray in color and rather coarse
in texture. The vase was modeled in the plain clay and permitted to
harden before the devices were engraved. After this a thick film of fine
yellowish-gray clay was applied to the face, partially filling up the engraved
lines. The remainder of the surface, including the lips, received
a thick coat of dark red paint. The whole surface was then highly
polished.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/407-1080.png"><img src="images/407-485.png" width="485" height="496" alt="Fig. 420.--Head-shaped vase: Pecan Point, Arkansas.--1/2" /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 420.</span>&mdash;Head-shaped vase: Pecan Point,
Arkansas.&mdash;&frac12;.</p></div>

<p>The illustration will convey a more vivid conception of this striking
head than any description that can be given. The face cannot be said
to have a single feature strongly characteristic of Indian physiognomy.
We have instead the round forehead and the projecting mouth of the
African. The nose, however, is small and the nostrils are narrow. The
face would seem to be that of a youngish person, perhaps a female.
The features are all well modeled, and are so decidedly individual in
character that the artist must have had in his mind a pretty definite
conception of the face to be produced as well as of the expression appropriate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>[page 408]</span>
to it, before beginning his work. It will be impossible, however,
to prove that the portrait of a particular personage was intended.
The closed eyes, the rather sunken nose, and the parted lips were certainly
intended to give the effect of death. The ears are large, correctly
placed, and well modeled; they are perforated all along the margin,
thus revealing a practice of the people to whom they referred. The
septum of the nose appears to have been pierced, and the horizontal depression
across the upper lip may indicate the former presence of a suspended
ornament.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/408a-648.png"><img src="images/408a-300.png" width="300" height="322" alt="Fig. 421.--The engraved figures." /></a>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 422.</span>&mdash;Head covering.</p></div>

<p>Perhaps the most unique and striking feature is the pattern of incised
lines that covers the greater part of the face. The lines are
deeply engraved and somewhat "scratchy," and were apparently executed
in the hardened clay before the slip was applied. The left side
of the face is plain, with the exception of a figure somewhat resembling
a grappling hook in outline which partially surrounds the eye.
The right side is covered with a comb-like pattern, placed vertically,
with the teeth upwards. The middle of the forehead has a series of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>[page 409]</span>
vertical lines and a few short horizontal ones just above the root of the
nose. There are also three curved lines near the corner of the mouth
not shown in the cut.</p>

<p>The diagram presented herewith (Fig. 421) gives in dotted lines the
correct outline of the front face, and shows projected in solid lines the
engraved figures. The significance of these markings can only be surmised
in the most general way. Their function is probably the same as
that of the tattooed and painted figures upon the faces of living races.</p>

<p>It will be well to observe that upon the forehead, at the top, there is
a small perforated knob or loop. Similar appendages may be seen
upon many of the clay human heads from this valley. A Mexican terra-cotta
head now in the museum at Mexico has a like feature, and, at the
same time, has closed eyes and an open mouth.</p>

<p>The head dress should be noticed. It seems to have been modeled
after a cloth or skin cap. It extends over the forehead, falls back over
the back of the head, and terminates in points behind, as seen in Fig.
422. Two layers of the material are represented, the one broad, the
other narrow and pointed, both being raised a little above the surface
upon which they rest. This vase head is somewhat smaller than the
average human head.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/409-1008.png"><img src="images/409-490.png" width="490" height="502" alt="Fig. 423.--Head-shaped vase: Pecan Point, Arkansas.--1/2" /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 423.</span>&mdash;Head-shaped vase: Pecan Point,

<p class="center">[<i>National Museum.</i>]</p></div>

<p>Another of a very similar character now in the Davenport Museum is
about one-half the size of this. The face is much mutilated.</p>

<p>A third is somewhat larger than the one illustrated, but is nearly the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>[page 410]</span>
same in finish and color. The face also has the semblance of death, but
the features are different, possessing very decided Indian characteristics.
There is no tattooing.</p>

<p>All of these heads, including also some of those in the National Museum,
are much alike in conception and execution.</p>

<p>This fact will be forcibly impressed upon the mind by a study of Fig.
423, which represents a specimen recently exhumed at Pecan Point by
agents of the Bureau of Ethnology. In size, form, color, finish, modeling
of features, and expression, this head closely resembles the one
first described. The work is not quite so carefully executed and the
head has probably not such pronounced individuality. The curious
device that in the other example appeared near the left eye here occurs
on both sides. The lower part of the face is elaborately engraved.
Three lines cross the upper lip and cheeks, reaching to the ear; a band
of fret-like devices extends across the mouth to the base of the ears, and
another band filled in with oblique reticulated lines passes around the
chin and along the jaws. The ears are perforated as in the other case
and the septum of the nose is partially broken away as if it had once
held a ring. A perforated knob has occupied the top of the forehead
as in the other case. The face is coated with a light yellowish gray slip,
and the remainder of the surface is red.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Thibault Collection.</i>]</p></div>

<p>Fig. 424 illustrates a very interesting specimen of the red pottery of
Arkansas. It belongs to the collection of Mr. Thibault, of Little Rock,
and was obtained from a mound in the vicinity of that city. The body
is slightly lenticular and the human face, which is modeled upon one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>[page 411]</span>
side, interferes but little with the outline. The face is slightly relieved
and extends from the neck of the vase to the widest part of the body,
and laterally occupies about one-third of the circumference. The middle
portion of the face is finished with a light flesh-colored slip, the remainder
of the surface of the vessel being painted a bright rich red.
Like the preceding example, the countenance is made to give the appearance
of death or sleep. Other face-vessels of scarcely less interest
are found in the Thibault collection.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em;"> HIGH-NECKED BOTTLES.</h3>

<p>High-necked, full-bodied bottles form a decided feature in the pottery
of this province. Similar vessels are rarely found in other sections of
the United States, but occur in Mexico and South America. The forms
are nowhere else so pronounced. They suggest the well-known water
bottles of eastern countries.</p>

<p>In material, finish, and decorative treatment they do not differ greatly
from the vases described in the preceding section.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Form.</span>&mdash;Their forms are greatly and often happily varied as will be

<p>A striking feature is found in the presence of legs and stands. The
former exhibit globular, conical, cylindrical, and terraced forms, Fig.
426. No example has any striking resemblance to European forms.
All are tripods, and are attached to ordinary forms of vessels in a way
to suggest that they are superadded features probably rather recently
acquired; at the same time legs were doubtless employed by the precolumbian
peoples. This is known to be true of Mexico, and Central
and South America. There is no reason why the mound-builders of the
Mississippi should not have discovered the use of such a device, readily
suggested by the use of supports in building, in baking, or in using the
vessels, and it would necessarily follow the modeling of life forms. It
is true that quadrupeds would not directly suggest the tripod, but birds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>[page 412]</span>
modeled in clay were made to rest upon the feet and tail, thus giving
three supports; besides it would readily be discovered that more than
three supports are unnecessary.</p>

<p>The stands attached to these bottles are not essentially different from
those described in the preceding section. They take the form of simple
bands, as seen at <i>a</i>, Fig. 427; double bands, as shown in <i>b</i> and
<i>c</i>;
or perforated feet, as seen in <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>Compound vessels are rather rare, nearly all of the varieties being
outlined in Fig. 428. Some of these are formed by uniting two or even
three simple forms in one. Others are only partially compound and resemble
the askoidal shapes of Greek art. Attention will be called to
the probable origin of all these shapes elsewhere.</p>

<p>Life forms are found in all the groups of ware, but differ in the manner
in which they are employed. Fig. 429 shows the usual methods of
adapting the human form to high-necked bottles. Quadrupeds, fishes,
and birds are treated in somewhat similar ways. The vessels represented
in this and the four preceding illustrations belong to the various
museums of the country.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ornament.</span>&mdash;The styles of decoration are not distinct from those of
other classes of vessels. The incised scroll patterns are sometimes very
elaborate, and the designs in color are perhaps executed with greater
care than in other groups.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Illustrations.</span>&mdash;<i>Ordinary forms.</i>&mdash;I have not thought it advisable
to figure many specimens of plain bottles, as all the varieties of outline
are repeated in the more highly elaborated or embellished pieces. Fig.
430 represents a plain bottle of the ordinary dark porous ware. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>[page 414]</span>
neck is narrow above and expands abruptly below. The body is globular.
Looking at this vessel with reference to a possible origin, we observe
its resemblance to a common form of gourd. By a review of the collection,
we find that there are many similar vessels actually modeled in
imitation of gourds. Good examples are given in the Third Annual
Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, from which Fig. 431 is taken, and
in a paper by Edward Evers in Contributions to the Arch&aelig;ology of
Missouri. The markings of the original are often shown with a great
deal of truthfulness in the earthenware reproductions.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/414a-642.png"><img src="images/414a-320.png" width="320" height="434" alt="Fig. 432.--Bottle: Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>[page 415]</span>

<p>Quite distinct in outline from the preceding forms is the bottle shown
in Fig. 432. The neck is high and cylindrical and the body resembles
a slightly-flattened globe. Set about the shoulder are four medallion-like
faces, the features of which are modeled roughly in low relief. The
ware is of the ordinary dark, slightly polished variety.</p>

<p>We have in Fig. 433 a good example of bottle-shaped vessels, the neck
of which is wide and short, and the body much compressed vertically.
There are a number of duplicates of it in the Museum. The specimen
illustrated is in the national collection, and was obtained in Arkansas.
It is a handsome vase, symmetrical in form, quite dark in color, and
highly polished. The upper surface of the body is ornamented with a
collar formed of a broad fillet of clay, or rather of two fillets, the pointed
ends of which unite on opposite sides of the vase.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/415-1098.png"><img src="images/415-470.png" width="470" height="498" alt="Fig. 434.--Bottle: Arkansas.--1/2." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 434.</span>&mdash;Bottle: Arkansas.&mdash;&frac12;.</p>
<p class="center">[<i>National Museum.</i>]</p></div>

<p>The handsome vase shown in Fig. 434 is of a somewhat different type
from the preceding. It was obtained, along with many other fine specimens,
from mounds near Little Rock, Arkansas. It is of the dark polished
ware with the usual fire mottlings. The form is symmetrical and
graceful. The neck is ornamented with a band of incised chevrons and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>[page 416]</span>
the sloping upper surface of the body, viewed from above, has a cruciform
arrangement of stepped figures engraved in the plastic clay.</p>

<p>One of the most striking of the bottle-shaped vases is shown in
Fig. 435. It is symmetrical in shape, well proportioned and well finished.
The color is now quite dark and the surface is roughened by a
multitude of pits which have resulted from the decay of shell particles.
The paste crumbles into a brownish dust when struck or pressed forcibly.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/416-864.png"><img src="images/416-380.png" width="380" height="488" alt="Fig. 435.--Engraved bottle: Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 435.</span>&mdash;Engraved bottle: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p>
<p class="center">[<i>National Museum.</i>]</p></div>

<p>By far the most remarkable feature of the piece is the broad, convex
hood-like collar that encircles the neck and spreads out over the body
like an inverted saucer. This collar is curiously wrought in incised
lines and low ridges by means of which two grotesque faces are produced.
The eyes are readily detected, being indicated by low knobs
with central pits surrounded each by three concentric circles. They
are arranged in pairs on opposite sides. Between the eyes of each pair
an incipient nose and mouth may be made out. The face is outlined
below by the lower edge of the collar and above, by a low indented
ridge crossing the collar tangent to the base of the neck.</p>

<p>The most expanded part of the body is encircled by an incised pattern
consisting of five sets of partially interlocked scrolls&mdash;an ornament
characteristic of the pottery of Arkansas.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>[page 417]</span>

<p>Modifications of the simple outlines of bottles exhibit many interesting
peculiarities. Compound forms are not unusual and consist generally
of imitations of two vessels, the one superimposed upon or set
in the mouth of another. A good example in the ordinary plain dark
ware is given in Fig. 436. Similar shapes are suggested by lobed forms
of the gourd.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/417a-744.png"><img src="images/417a-360.png" width="360" height="395" alt="Fig. 436.--Bottle: Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 436.</span>&mdash;Bottle: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>Other specimens may be seen in which there is only a gentle swelling
of the neck, but all gradations occur between this condition and that
in which forms of two vessels distinctly appear.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/417b-648.png"><img src="images/417b-320.png" width="320" height="290" alt="Fig. 437.--Bottle: Pecan Point, Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 437.</span>&mdash;Bottle: Pecan Point, Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>A very usual form is illustrated in Fig. 437. Below the overhanging
lip the neck contracts and then expands until quite full, and at the base
contracts again. This feature corresponds to the upper vessel suggested
in the preceding case. Four flattened handles are placed about
the upper part of the neck and three rows of small conical pits encircle
the most expanded portion. The body is plain and much compressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>[page 418]</span>
vertically. A low wide stand is attached to the base. A number
of good examples, now in the National Museum, were found in
Arkansas.</p>

<p>The vase shown in Fig. 438 has also the double body, the vessels
copied having been somewhat more elaborately modeled than in the
preceding cases. A bottle is set within the mouth of a pot. The neck
is high, wide, and flaring and rests upon the back of a rudely modeled
frog, which lies extended upon the upper surface of the body. The
notched encircling ridge beneath the feet of the reptile represents the
rim of the lower vessel, which is a pot with compressed globular body
and short, wide neck. This vase is of the dark, dead-surfaced ware and
is quite plain. Four vertical ridges take the place of handles. I have
observed other examples in which two vessels, combined in this way,
served as models for the potter; one, a shell set within a cup, is illustrated
in the Third Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology; another
is given in Contributions to the Arch&aelig;ology of Missouri.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/418-714.png"><img src="images/418-320.png" width="320" height="500" alt="Fig. 438.--Bottle: Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 438.</span>&mdash;Bottle: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>Fig. 439 illustrates a rather graceful form of bottle. It is furnished
with a rather high perforated stand or foot, and the body is fluted vertically
with narrow, widely separated channels. The neck is high and
flaring and has a narrow notched collar at the base.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>[page 419]</span>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 440.</span>&mdash;Engraved bottle: Arkansas. (?)&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>There are many good examples of engraved geometric designs upon
bottle-shaped vessels. One of the most elaborate is presented in Fig.
440. This vessel has a full, wide neck, a heavy, flattened body, and a
broad rudimentary foot. The color is quite dark, and the surface well
polished. The engraved design consists of four elaborate, interlinked
scrolls, comprising a number of lines, and bordered by wing-like, triangular
figures, filled in with reticulated lines. This latter feature is
often associated with native delineations of mythic reptiles, and it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>[page 420]</span>
not impossible that this scroll work is a highly conventionalized form
of some such conception. The four volute centers are slightly concave.</p>

<p>Three excellent examples of tripod bottles are illustrated in the accompanying
figures. The first, Fig. 441, is a large-necked, rather clumsy
vessel of ordinary workmanship, which rests upon three globular legs.
These are hollow and the cavities connect with that of the body of the
vessel. The whole surface is well polished and very dark.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/420-750.png"><img src="images/420-340.png" width="340" height="498" alt="Fig. 441.--Tripod bottle: Arkansas.(?)--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 441.</span>&mdash;Tripod bottle: Arkansas.(?)&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>The vessel depicted in Fig. 442 has a number of noteworthy features.
In shape, it resembles the preceding with the exception of the legs, which
are flat and have stepped or terraced margins. The whole surface of the
vessel is decorated with characteristic designs in red and white upon a
warm gray ground. A stepped figure, resembling the Pueblo emblematic
"rim of the sky," encircles the neck, and semicircular figures in white
appear on opposite sides at the top and base. The body is covered with
scroll work in broad red lines, the spaces being filled in with white in
the form of a thick earthy paste. Each of the legs has one-half red
and the other white.</p>

<p>The vessel illustrated in Fig. 443 is of ordinary, dark, polished ware,
and is entirely plain. It is peculiar in the shape of its extremities.
The neck resembles a long truncated cone, and the legs are heavy and
conical, being not unlike those of a common iron pot.</p>

<p><i>Eccentric forms.</i>&mdash;In this place I am able to give but one example of
what I have denominated eccentric forms. Others have been indicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>[page 421]</span>
on preceding pages. The vase given in Fig. 444 has a flattish, ovoidal
body from the opposite ends of which springs a hollow arch&mdash;a sort of
double neck. This has been perforated at the highest point, and a low
recurving rim, which serves as the mouth of the vessel, has been
attached.</p>

<p>Another example of this form has recently been received at the
Davenport Museum. It is in fragments, but was originally nicely finished
and painted. Illustrations of others may be seen in the Third
Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, and in Contributions to
the Arch&aelig;ology of Missouri. The specimen illustrated was found at
the foot of a skeleton in a grave at Pecan Point.</p>

<p>This shape is common to the art of many countries, and was a great
favorite in ancient Peru.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/422b-624.png"><img src="images/422b-300.png" width="300" height="444" alt="Fig. 445.--Owl-shaped bottle: Arkansas.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 445.</span>&mdash;Owl-shaped bottle: Arkansas.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p><i>Life forms.</i>&mdash;In the introduction to this section, I have indicated the
many ways in which the human form is employed in the embellishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>[page 423]</span>
or the elaboration of bottles. Birds, beasts, fishes, and reptiles are
treated in a similar manner.</p>

<p>The owl was a favorite subject with the potter, probably on account
of the upright, compact figure of the body, or possibly because of some
especial regard in which this bird was held.</p>

<p>A rather handsome specimen is shown in Fig. 445. The modeling is
more than usually successful, and the surface is carefully finished. The
wings are treated in a pleasing but highly conventional manner. The
plumage is indicated by alternate bands of pale-red and yellow-gray,
the latter being the ground color. These bands are outlined by fine
incised lines. The remainder of the body is painted red. The vessel
rests upon the feet and tail&mdash;a natural tripod. In many cases the head
of the bird forms the top of the neck of the bottle&mdash;the body of the vessel
itself being plain and globular.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="images/423-1128.png"><img src="images/423-600.png" width="600" height="249" alt="Fig. 446.--Hale's Point, Tennessee.--1/3; Fig. 447.--Arkansas (?).--1/3." /></a>

<span style="float: right"><span class="sc">Fig. 447.</span>&mdash;Arkansas (?).&mdash;&#8531;.</span></p></div>

<p>The heads of animals are treated in the same manner, as may be seen
by reference to Figs. 446 and 447.</p>

<p>The head shown in Fig. 446 is clearly that of a bear. The whole vessel
is painted red. Fig. 447 illustrates a small dark bottle, surmounted
by a head of nondescript character. The aperture in these vessels is
generally at the back of the head.</p>

<p>Fish and reptiles appear somewhat more rarely in connection with
high-necked bottles. The Davenport Museum has recently acquired a
fine example, painted in red and white, which has the head and other
features of a fish, modeled in relief upon the sides and bottom of the
body. A small, dark vessel of like character is illustrated in the Third
Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology.</p>

<p>In the example given in Figs. 448 and 449 the upper part of the neck
has been modified in such a way as to accommodate a curious, medallion-like
relievo of the human face, while in Figs. 450 and 451 the neck is replaced
by grotesque heads, the latter being intended apparently for an
owl.</p>

<p>These potters dealt with the human figure in a very bold manner for
savages. They were evidently capable of representing many creatures
with accuracy, but preferred grotesque or conventional forms. A man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>[page 424]</span>
or a woman is generally modeled with a large body and a curious hunched
back, the vertebr&aelig; appearing along the prominent ridge. The shoulder
blades are usually shown with anatomical distinctness, if not with precision;
the arms are long and slender and the hands rest upon the
knees or the sides. The position assumed is mostly that of kneeling or
squatting, the feet being doubled up beneath and uniting with the bottom
of the vessel.</p>

<p>These effigy vases are numerous, and greatly varied in size and color.
They are mostly of the dark ware, but are found painted plain red or
in red and white figures, some of which represent parts of the costume,
others, emblematic devices. The largest specimen with which I am
acquainted is illustrated in Fig. 452. It is well modeled, a good deal of
attention having been given to the details of anatomy. The back is
very much humped, and the vertebr&aelig; are represented by a series of
knobs. The position of the feet beneath the body is, perhaps, worthy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>[page 425]</span>
of notice. This is shown in Fig. 453<i>b</i>. It will be seen that the knees,
calves, ankles, and the various parts of the feet are indicated with an
approach to accuracy. The projecting back is seen below. The bottom
of the vessel is nearly flat, and the legs are modeled in low relief upon
it. Other positions are shown in Fig. 453.</p>

<p>One of these vases has a cross painted upon the breast of the personage
represented. The kneeling position, taken in connection with the
cross, leads to the thought that perhaps the potter lived in the period
of the French missionary, and attempted to model him in clay. There
is, however, no indication of costume, and the painting, with the exception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>[page 426]</span>
of the cross, is in a purely aboriginal style of design. The ground
color of the vase is, as usual, a moderately dark gray brown, and the
painted figures are laid on in thick, blackish paint. Lines partially encircle
the eyes, and extend down over the cheek to the neck, and a line
passes around the mouth and extends down over the chin, neck, and
chest to the base of the body. The horizontal bar of the cross connects
the nipples. The shoulder blades and the hands are also painted black.
The back is very curiously modeled and painted.</p>

<p>There are in the collection a number of specimens that do not come
under either of the preceding heads. Of these I may mention three
small figures from Paducah, Kentucky, which represent a snake, a man,
and a deer. They are very rudely done, and are possibly modern work.</p>

<p>Attention should be called to some small specimens resembling toadstools
or mushrooms in shape, some of which may have been stoppers
for bottles, while others could have served as implements in some of
the arts. One of these pieces has a distinctly vitrified surface. Its age,
however, cannot be determined.</p>

<p>There are a few rude pipes of usual forms and of no special interest.</p>

<p>The comparative scarcity of these articles, so plentiful in some of the
mound districts, is certainly worthy of the attention of arch&aelig;ologists.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em;"> UPPER MISSISSIPPI PROVINCE:</h3>

<p>I have already pointed out the fact that most of the pottery of the
Upper Mississippi region belongs to a distinct family. It has never
been as abundant as the pottery of the more southern sections of the
country and is not well represented in our museums. There are only a
few pieces in the Davenport collection and these are all in a more or less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>[page 427]</span>
fragmentary state. A majority are from a mound near the city of
Davenport, but a limited number came from Wisconsin.</p>

<p>At this time it is impossible to define, with any degree of precision,
the geographical limits of this class of ware. The tribes by whom it
was manufactured have evidently, at one time or another, occupied the
greater part of the Mississippi basin north of the mouth of the Missouri
River. Similarities of material, shape, methods of manufacture, and
ornamentation, tend to show that we must include the greater parts of
the States of Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio,
in the area covered by this or closely related ceramic groups, and indications
of its presence are discovered far beyond these limits. The
mounds of Manitoba have recently furnished examples of this class of
ware, and it has decided relationships with the ware of the Eastern and
Northeastern States. It is not yet time to draw close distinctions, as
sufficiently detailed studies of the products of the various districts
have not been made.</p>

<p>On the shelves of our museums the difference between the two great
families of the middle and Upper Mississippi are strikingly manifest.
The ware of the former district, as already shown, exhibits variously
tinted pastes tempered with coarsely pulverized shells or potsherds;
the vases, as a rule, having full bodies, well rounded bases, and in very
many cases, narrow necks. They exhibit great variety of decoration
and no little care in finish. The northern family shows a dark paste
tempered with sand, often apparently granitic; a rough fracture, and
generally a rude finish. The shapes are comparatively simple, often
long, tapering below, and flat bottomed. The ornamentation is totally
unlike that of the southern variety. It consists of cord impressions,
incised lines, and implement indentations arranged in figures peculiar
to the district. There are many other features that, like the subtile characters
of human physiognomy, cannot easily be described, but which
are of first importance as indices of relationship or the lack of it.</p>

<p>The best preserved of the Davenport specimens was described and
illustrated in the first volume of the proceedings of the Davenport
Academy. This vessel, Fig. 456, was found in a mound near Davenport
along with human remains, and closely associated with other relics,
among which were several copper implements covered with coarse woven
fabrics. Its height is eleven inches, width of aperture seven and a half
inches, and diameter of base four inches. It is estimated to contain a
little over one gallon.</p>

<p>There is a broad, shallow constriction at the neck. The walls are
from one-fourth to three-eighths of an inch thick, and the margin of
the rim is squared off, showing the full thickness&mdash;a strong characteristic
of the northern pottery. The form is nearly symmetrical, and
the surface is hand-smoothed but not polished. The paste is now
dark and crumbling, and shows a rough fracture. A large percentage
of sand was used in tempering. The color is a dark gray-brown. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>[page 428]</span>
entire surface, with the exception of a narrow band about the base, has
been covered with ornamentation. This is executed with considerable
care, and shows a great deal of ingenuity and some taste. There is apparently
no feature copied from nature or from ideographic art. Two
or three distinct implements have been used. A part of the neck ornament
was made by rolling back and forth a circular tool, a <i>roulette</i>,
the edge of which was notched. A row of indented nodes has been
produced upon the exterior surface of the neck by impressing upon the
inside the end of a reed or hollow bone about one-fourth of an inch in
diameter. Patterns of bold, rather carelessly drawn lines cover the
body and seem to have been made by trailing, under pretty strong
pressure, the smooth point of a stylus&mdash;probably the bone or reed already
suggested. Some of the larger indentations upon the lower part
of the neck may have been made by the same implement held in an
oblique position. The use to which this vessel was applied can hardly
be guessed. It was found with the remains of its owner, and probably
contained food or drink.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 456.</span>&mdash;Vase: Davenport, Iowa.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>Another smaller vessel from the same locality and found under similar
conditions shows the same characteristics of material, form, and ornament.
There are also a few other fragments of the same ware from
this group of mounds. One of these shows that decoration by the indentation
of twisted cords was practiced here as elsewhere. A similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>[page 429]</span>
vase tastefully decorated with indented lines about the neck, and a
band of decoration consisting of broad, plain, sinuous bands upon the
body, comes from a mound in Scott County, Iowa. Height six inches,
diameter the same. The rims of all these vessels are square on the
edge, showing the full thickness of the walls.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/429-1020.png"><img src="images/429-400.png" width="400" height="428" alt="Fig. 457.--Vase: Wisconsin.--1/2." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 457.</span>&mdash;Vase: Wisconsin.&mdash;&frac12;.</p>
<p class="center">[<i>National Museum.</i>]</p></div>

<p>A very interesting vessel obtained by Captain Hall from a mound in
Wisconsin is represented by a number of large fragments, probably
comprising about one-half of the walls. It must have been somewhat
larger than the vase given in Fig. 456, and in a general way resembles it
closely. It appears to be more pointed below than the other, and has a
slightly flaring rim. The walls are one-fourth of an inch thick. The paste
is coarse and is tempered with sand, as in the cases already described.
The lower part of the body is covered with nearly vertical cord marks.
The upper part was smoothed, rather rudely, for the reception of additional
decoration, which consists of several bands of indented figures.
The principal implement used was apparently a stiff cord, or a slender
osier wrapped with fine thread, which has been laid on and impressed
with the fingers, forming nearly continuous encircling lines. Bands of
short oblique lines made in the same manner also occur. Just below
the margin there is a line of annular indentations made from the exterior,
leaving nodes on the inside&mdash;the reverse of the treatment noticed
in the vessel already illustrated. Fragments of identically marked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>[page 430]</span>
ware from the vicinity of Prairie du Chien may be seen in the National
Museum.</p>

<p>A large fragment from Baraboo County, Wisconsin, shows a full
body and a slightly flaring rim. The upper part is ornamented with
horizontal lines of annular indentations, and the body is covered with
rather rude patterns made by rolling a notched wheel or <i>roulette</i> back
and forth in zigzag lines.</p>

<p>Two handsome pieces of this ware were recently obtained by the
Bureau of Ethnology from a mound in Vernon County, Wisconsin.
The finest of these, which is shown in Fig. 457, is six and a half inches
in height, and in symmetry and finish rivals the best work of the south.
The paste is dark, compact, and fine grained, and tempered apparently
with sand. The color of the surface is a rich, mottled brown. The
most striking feature of the decoration consists of a number of polished
bands, extending in divers directions over the surface, the interstices
being filled in with indented figures. The lip is smooth and the margin
rounded. The exterior surface of the narrow collar is ornamented with
oblique lines made by a <i>roulette</i>, and crossed at intervals with fine
incised lines. The neck is slightly constricted, and is encircled by a
polished zone one and one-fourth inches wide, having a line of indentations
along the upper edge. The body is separated into four lobes by
four vertical, depressed, polished bands about one inch wide. Two of
these lobes are crossed obliquely by similar polished bands. These
bands were all finished with a polishing implement, and are somewhat
depressed, probably the result of strong pressure with this tool. They
are bordered by wide incised lines. The intervening spaces are indented
with a <i>roulette</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 458.</span>&mdash;Vase; Illinois.&mdash;&frac34;.</p></div>

<p>A handsome little vessel, obtained from a mound at Albany, Whitesides
County, Illinois, is illustrated in Fig. 458. It apparently belongs
to the silicious ware of the north. The shape and ornamentation are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>[page 431]</span>
somewhat novel. Four large flattish lobes occur about the body, on
each of which a figure somewhat resembling a Maltese cross has been
made by incising or impressing broad, shallow lines. The remainder
of the body is covered with marks that resemble impressions of a coarse
osier basket. This specimen was collected by Mr. C. A. Dodge, and a
short description was published by Prof. W. H. Pratt in the third volume
of the proceedings of the Davenport Academy.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em;"> GULF PROVINCE.</h3>

<p>Our museums contain but few pieces of pottery from the Lower Mississippi,
and in the Davenport Academy collection there are probably
not more than a dozen typical examples of the leading varieties of ware
of the Gulf States. Louisiana and Mississippi have furnished some
very fine specimens of the pottery of the middle province, more refined,
perhaps, in form, material, and finish than the ware of Arkansas and
Missouri, but still differing decidedly from the typical pottery of Alabama
and Georgia. Not wishing at present to enter upon the detailed
study of the latter class of ware, I shall present only the few examples
contained in the Davenport collection. The southern ware is characterized
by refinement of outline, color, finish and ornament, and is distinguished
from that of the Middle Mississippi by its material, which is
a fine-grained paste, tempered with very fine silicious matter instead of
pulverized shells.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/431-402.png"><img src="images/431-150.png" width="150" height="65" alt="Fig. 459.--Cup: Alabama.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 459.</span>&mdash;Cup: Alabama.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>The little cup given in Fig. 459 is from Mobile, Alabama. It is
pointed at opposite ends and was probably modeled after or within some
basket or fruit shell, the impressions from which are seen on the surface.
The paste contains no perceptible tempering material.</p>

<p>The largest and most pleasing vessel of this class is from Alabama,
and is shown in Fig. 460.</p>

<p>The aperture is ten and a half inches in diameter, and the height
nine and one-half inches. The form is full above and somewhat conical
below. The walls are thin and even and the surface well polished.</p>

<p>The color is dark and shows the usual fire mottlings. There is no admixture
of shell material, finely pulverized micaceous matter appearing
in its place. The ornamentation is simple, but is applied in a way
to greatly enhance the beauty of the vessel. It consists of a single
broad zone of incised figures. Three zigzag lines meander the middle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>[page 432]</span>
of the band and the intervening triangles are filled in with groups of
straight lines. All the lines are well drawn and appear to have been
cut with a sharp point in the dry clay.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/432a-1320.png"><img src="images/432a-600.png" width="600" height="439" alt="Fig. 460.--Bowl: Alabama.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 460.</span>&mdash;Bowl: Alabama.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>Bottle-shaped vases are not found to any great extent outside of
the Mississippi Valley, and are quite rare in Alabama, Georgia, and
Florida.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/432b-702.png"><img src="images/432b-300.png" width="300" height="305" alt="Fig. 461.--Bottle: Mississippi.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 461.</span>&mdash;Bottle: Mississippi.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>The piece illustrated in Fig. 461 is from Mississippi, and in most respects
is identical with the ware of the Gulf Province. The paste is
silicious, fine-grained, and quite hard. The color is slightly ferruginous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>[page 433]</span>
and clouded with fire stains from the baking. The body is ornamented
with the engraved figure of a bird apparently intended for an eagle.
The head, with its notched and strongly curved beak and conventionalized
crest, occupies one side. The wings may be seen at the right and
left, while the tail appears on the side opposite the head. The flattened
base of the vessel occupies the place of the body. The lines have
been scratched with a sharp point in the hardened clay. Certain spaces
in the plumes, wings, and tail are filled in with reticulated lines.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/433-678.png"><img src="images/433-320.png" width="320" height="402" alt="Fig. 462.--Bottle: Alabama.--1/3." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fig. 462.</span>&mdash;Bottle: Alabama.&mdash;&#8531;.</p></div>

<p>The bottle presented in Fig. 462 is embellished with a rather remarkable
design in color. The material is fine grained and without admixture
of shell. The color of the paste is a pale, salmon gray. The
surface is coated with a thick slip or enamel of whitish clay, very fine
grained and smooth; upon this the design was painted, not in the
thick earthy color employed farther north, but in what appears to be a
dark purplish-gray stain. The design upon the body is wholly unlike
anything yet described. It is developed in the light ground tint by
filling in the interstices with the dark color. The peculiar character of
this design inclines me to the view that it probably had an ideographic
origin, although possibly treated here as pure decoration. The open
hand is sometimes seen, in both the decorative and the symbolic work
of the Gulf coast tribes, and is not unknown elsewhere. The figures
alternating with the hands are suggestive of a highly conventionalized
face, the eyes being indicated by the volutes and the mouth and teeth
by the lower part of the figure, as will be seen in the fully projected
design, Fig. 463. The neck has two indistinct bands of triangular dentate
figures apparently painted in the dark color. The bottom is flattish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>[page 434]</span>
and without the coating of light clay. Both paste and slip can be
readily scratched with the finger nail. This vase was found in Franklin
County, Alabama, near the Mississippi line.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em;"> R&Eacute;SUM&Eacute;.</h3>

<p>Attention has been called to the great numbers of pieces of earthenware
recovered from the mounds and graves of the middle province of
the Mississippi Valley. In certain districts&mdash;as remarked by one of our
collectors&mdash;we have but to dig to fill museums. Such districts must
have been occupied for a long period by a numerous people who recognized
the claims of the dead upon their worldly treasures. The burial
grounds of many other sections of the American continent are correspondingly
rich in ceramic remains.</p>

<p>The vessels were not to any extent cinerary, and probably not even
mortuary in the sense of having been constructed especially for inhumation
with the dead. They were receptacles for food, drink, paint, and
the like, placed in the grave along with other possessions of the departed
in obedience to the demands of an almost universal custom.</p>

<p>The material employed in manufacture embraced clay in all grades
of refinement, from coarse loamy earths to the refined slips used in surface
finish. The tempering materials&mdash;used in greater or lesser quantity
according to the character of the vessel to be made&mdash;consisted of
shell, sand, and potsherds reduced to various degrees of pulverulence.</p>

<p>The stage of the art represented by this ware is one of hand building
purely. No lathe or other revolving device was known, although varieties
of improvised molds&mdash;baskets, gourds, and the like, such as are
known to nearly all pottery-making peoples&mdash;were frequently employed.</p>

<p>The highest degree of finish known was attained by the application
of a slip or wash of fine clay which was given a good degree of mechanical
polish by means of a smooth implement held in the hand. Ornament
was produced by both flat and plastic methods. The colors used
in painting were white, black, and red earths. The plastic subjects
were incised, stamped, relieved, and modeled in the round.</p>

<p>The period was one of open-air baking, a moderate degree of hardness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id="page435"></a>[page 435]</span>
being secured. The texture was porous and the vessels were without
resonance. The paste exhibits two distinct varieties of color which
may be described roughly as light and dark. A certain range of dark
hues&mdash;blacks, browns, and grays&mdash;were probably produced by "smother
baking." Another set of colors embracing light reddish and yellowish
grays resulted from changes in the clay produced by simple open air
baking.</p>

<p>A feature worthy of especial note is the great diversity of form&mdash;indicating
a long practice of the art, a high specialization of uses, and a considerable
variety in the originals copied. The manual skill exhibited
is of no mean order. Symmetry of form combined with considerable
grace of outline has been achieved without the wheel&mdash;a result attained
in still greater perfection by other American races. Notwithstanding
the great diversity of the forms of vessels, the very primitive condition of
the art is indicated by the absence of bricks, tiles, whistles, lamps,
spindle-whorls,
toys, and statuettes. The models from which the vessels
were copied must have been quite varied, comprising shells of mollusks&mdash;marine
and fresh-water&mdash;gourd shells of varying shapes, and vessels of
wicker, bark, horn, and wood, such as are in common use with our
western and northern tribes.</p>

<p>The execution of the ornamental designs indicates a rather low grade
of skill. This is especially true of work in color, which has the appearance
of a newly acquired art. Intaglio and relief work evinces much
greater skill&mdash;the incised forms especially giving evidence of long experience.</p>

<p>In subject-matter the ornament employed bespeaks nothing higher
perhaps than could be expected of our historic tribes. The great body
of the devices are geometric, and comprise such motives as could have
developed within the art or that might have been borrowed from closely
associated arts. A small percentage of incised linear designs come, apparently,
from mythologic sources, and delineate, in a rude way, both
men and animals.</p>

<p>The modeling of life forms in connection with earthen vessels constitutes
a feature of considerable interest, the highest known achievement
being represented by a series of vases imitating human heads. Animal
forms are generally rudely modeled, the imitation of nature having
been apparently a secondary consideration&mdash;the associated idea or
the fancy for the grotesque being the stronger motive. The animal
forms are inferior to those carved in stone by some of the mound-building
peoples.</p>

<p>That any of these images were idols in the ordinary acceptation of the
term is an idea that cannot be entertained. They are always associated
directly with vessels, and could not be more than representations of the
tutelary deities supposed to be interested in the uses or ceremonies to
which the vessels were assigned.</p>

<p>In form there are many suggestions of the characteristic utensils of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>[page 436]</span>
the north, in ornament there are occasional hints of the south&mdash;of Caribbean
and Mexican art.</p>

<p>With the Pueblo peoples, notwithstanding their proximity, there is
hardly a hint of relationship of any kind. Unlike the Pueblos, the
ethnical environment of the Mississippi Valley races would seem to have
been considerably diversified; there was less isolation; yet there are
strong indications that the art is mainly of indigenous growth, as there
is unity and consistency in all its features.</p>

<p>In reference to the period of culture represented by this ware, a few
words may be added. There is no feature in it that could not reasonably
be expected of the more advanced historic tribes of the Valley. It indicates
a culture differing in many ways from that of the Pueblos, ancient
and modern, but on the whole rather inferior to it. The work of
Mexico, Central and South America is decidedly superior in every essential
feature.</p>

<p>There are many difficulties in the way of instituting a comparison of
this work with that of the primitive work of the Old World. These I
shall not stop to present in this place. In the most general way, I may
say that the ceramic art of the Middle Mississippi is apparently superior
to that of the stone age in Europe, but little can be inferred in regard
to relative grades of culture. In classic countries it is difficult to find
its true equivalent. To reach a stage of art correspondingly low we
shall have to go behind the heroic age&mdash;to pass down through more than
the five prehistoric cities of the hill of Hissarlik and descend into the
lowest arch&aelig;ologic substratum. Even this, unless it represent the first
achievement of that grade of art upon the continent, would afford uncertain
data for comparative study.</p>

<p>A given grade of ceramic achievement runs so freely up and down
the scale of culture that alone its evidence is of little value in determining
culture status.</p>
